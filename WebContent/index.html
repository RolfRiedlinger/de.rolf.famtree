				<H1>Rolf's Family Tree project Version 1.1</H1> Welcome to my new
				project and thanks in advance for spending these few minutes, so
				that I can explain what it is all about. I'd like to create a family
				tree which shows our relation to our ancestors and to each other. It
				is as simple as this and its motivated by the fact, that I and my
				siblings are all spread over southern Germany and Switzerland as
				well as I realize that my grand-aunts are getting older and older
				and with some of them already gone, their knowledge about relatives
				is retrievably gone too. So the intention is to create a big map of
				relationships and you can contribute to it by simply adding new
				persons or update existing ones. The data will not be published to
				anybody besides the family and it resides on my private server.
				That's all for now -- Try it out !! !
				<p /> regards Rolf
